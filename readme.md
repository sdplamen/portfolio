## My first Portfolio Website

This is a simple Django project portfolio website that I made following my education of Software Engineering with Python in SoftUni.

I learned so much while making this template, if you use it, please let me know. I would love to see how amazing people can make it! I hope you'll like it!

## I have used:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling 
+ Bit of **DTL** to inherit HTML templates
+ Bit of **custom filter tags** to improve my business logic
+ Bit of **Django views** to render my HTML templates
+ Bit of **Django models** to manage my PostgreSQL database
+ **Implemented Font Montserrat** as my favourite font
+ And all the required things using **Django framework** to make my project awesome
